### Hello! I'm Keivan Mojmali. A Full Stack Web Developer

From Southern California :sunrise:. Mainly coding in JavaScript, React and building APIs with Node and Express. Outside of programming, I bring value to my team with abstract thinking, problem solving and a work ethic that I take great pride in. Learning about how much you can accomplish with a computer led me to become a Full Stack Developer. Joining the Open Source community and contributing code to make the world more accessible for everyone is my passion. If that sounds like something you are passionate about as well, then lets chat! :smiley:
